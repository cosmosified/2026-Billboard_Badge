"""Button interface for the Billboard Badge

    from lib.button import UserA
    if UserA.pressed():      # True once per press
        ...
    UserA.is_down()          # live state
    UserA.held_ms()          # how long it has been held (0 if up)

Buttons are polled every 5 ms and a level has to be stable for
STABLE_SAMPLES polls before it counts, so short glitches are ignored. A press
nobody reads is kept for UNREAD_TTL_MS after release (so quick taps aren't
lost while an app is busy), then forgotten, so it can't leak into the app menu
later and launch something on its own.
